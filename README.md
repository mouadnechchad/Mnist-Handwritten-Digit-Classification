# Mnist-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
I built a CNN model to recognize handwritten digits using the Keras library, assuming it is part of a larger Python script for image classification. Let's provide a brief description of this model's architecture:

1. **Sequential Model:** This is a sequential neural network model, which means that layers are added sequentially, one after the other.

2. **Convolutional Layers:** There are three convolutional layers in this model, each with 64 filters of size (3,3). These layers are responsible for learning spatial patterns and features in the input image data. After each convolution operation, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity.

3. **Max-Pooling Layers:** After each convolutional layer, there is a max-pooling layer with a (2,2) pool size. Max-pooling helps reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and retains the most important information.

4. **Flatten Layer:** After the last max-pooling layer, the feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector. This prepares the data for the fully connected layers.

5. **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers:**
- The first fully connected layer consists of 64 neurons with ReLU activation.
- The second fully connected layer consists of 32 neurons with ReLU activation.
- The final fully connected layer consists of 10 neurons with softmax activation. This is typically used in multi-class classification problems and produces a probability distribution over 10 classes (assuming this is a classification task).

In summary, this model is designed for image classification tasks, and it consists of a series of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The number of neurons in the fully connected layers and the architecture of the convolutional layers can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your task and dataset.
